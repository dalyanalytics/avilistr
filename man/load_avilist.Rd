\usage{
load_avilist(
  version = "full",
  filter_rank = NULL,
  families = NULL,
  orders = NULL,
  region = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{Character. Which version to load: "full" (default) includes all
fields from the extended AviList dataset, "short" includes only essential
taxonomic fields from the official short version.}

\item{filter_rank}{Character vector. Filter by taxonomic ranks. Options include
"species", "subspecies", "genus", "family", "order". Default NULL returns all ranks.}

\item{families}{Character vector. Filter by specific family names (e.g., "Turdidae").
Default NULL returns all families.}

\item{orders}{Character vector. Filter by specific order names (e.g., "Passeriformes").
Default NULL returns all orders.}

\item{region}{Character. Filter by biogeographic region based on type locality
(if available). Default NULL returns all regions.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the requested AviList data with additional attributes:
\itemize{
\item version: Which dataset version was loaded
\item loaded_at: Timestamp of when data was loaded
\item filters: List of applied filters
\item summary: Basic statistics about the loaded data
}
}
\description{
Load the AviList global bird checklist data with optional filtering.
This is the main function to access the unified global bird taxonomy
created by the AviList Core Team.
}
\details{
The AviList dataset represents the first unified global checklist of bird species,
harmonizing previous differences between IOC, Clements, and BirdLife taxonomies.

\strong{Version differences:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{full}: All 26 fields including nomenclatural details, URLs, and bibliographic info
\item \strong{short}: Essential taxonomic fields only, faster loading for basic operations
}

\strong{Performance tips:}
\itemize{
\item Use \code{version = "short"} for faster loading when you don't need all fields
\item Filter at load time rather than after loading for better memory efficiency
\item Use \code{filter_rank = "species"} to exclude subspecies for most analyses
}
}
\examples{
# Load full dataset
avilist_full <- load_avilist()

# Load only species (no subspecies) from short version
species_only <- load_avilist(version = "short", filter_rank = "species")

# Load specific bird families
raptors <- load_avilist(
  families = c("Accipitridae", "Falconidae", "Strigidae"),
  filter_rank = "species"
)

# Load all passerines (songbirds)
songbirds <- load_avilist(
  orders = "Passeriformes",
  version = "short"
)

# Examine the loaded data
str(species_only)
attr(species_only, "summary")
